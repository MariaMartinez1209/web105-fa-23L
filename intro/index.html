    <h1>Daniela's hobby</h1>

    <h2>Dogs</h2>
    <p>Having a dog is like having a constant source of fun. They do the silliest things, 
        like chasing their tails or looking puzzled when we talk. <br>Playing fetch with them is a blast because 
        they're always so excited. Dogs make regular days way more exciting and remind us to enjoy <br>the happy 
        moments and have a good laugh.</p>

    <h3>Why dogs?</h3>

    <h2>Lear Japanese</h2>
    <p>Learning Japanese can be super interesting! You get to understand anime, manga, and cool video games 
        without relying on translations. <br>Japan's rich culture and history also come alive when you learn the 
        language.</p>

    <h2>Crochet</h2>
    <p>Crocheting is a fun hobby because it's like creating colorful puzzles with yarn and a special hook. 
        You can make cozy scarves, soft blankets, <br>and even cute toys by looping the yarn in different ways. 
        It's like painting but with yarn, where you mix colors and patterns to make something <br>totally unique. 
        It's a bit like magic, you start with simple materials and end up with something beautiful and warm that you 
        can use or share with <br>your friends and family. Plus, it's a great way to relax and let your creativity 
        flow while keeping your hands busy.</p>
