      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Cereza and the Lost Demon</strong> suggests a
      magical and dreamy world that takes ideas from the Brothers Grimm tales.
      It's like a place where most of the exciting stuff happens in an enchanted
      forest with magical creatures, witches, and demons.

    <h3>The beginning</h3>

    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Morgana</b>, Cereza's teacher, decides that it's
      time for the young witch to summon her first <em>demon</em>. She succeeds,
      but gets scared, causing the contract not to be completed. Cereza wants to
      prove to Morgana that she can do it, so she decides to go into the forest
      <em>that her teacher warned her about many times.</em>
    </p>

    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the forest, she faces her first enemies. The scared
      girl summons a demon to defend herself, but she forgets to give it a body.
      In its desperation, the demon enters the stuffed cat toy that the girl had
      with her.
